# Palindrome Checker

This website checks whether a string is a palindrome or not.

### What is a Palindrome?

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as it does forward. This means it's literally "running back" on itself when you read it from either direction.

### Here are some common examples of palindromes:

- Words: madam, racecar, level, kayak, rotor, refer
- Numbers: 121, 1111, 2002, 58585
